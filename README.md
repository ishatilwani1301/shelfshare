## Purpose :- 


# ðŸ¥³ Features
- âœ… New users can register for Bookshelfy
- âœ… Allows users to login and logout
- âœ… Allows users to browse the public library
- âœ… Users can issue books from the library
- âœ… Users can add books to their bookshelf
- âœ… Allows users to return their issued books
- âœ… Update the number of available and issued books in the library for transparency
- âœ… Users shouldn't be able to view other's bookshelves
- âœ… Creates a custom route for each user associated with their userID
- âœ… Doesn't allow to access library without signing in
- âœ… Doesn't allow to submit new book without all information
- âœ… **Book Management:** Add, view, and manage your books.
- âœ… **Note Taking:** Add multiple notes for each book.
- âœ…**AI-Powered Summarization:** Automatically generates a concise summary of all notes for a given book.
    * Summarization is triggered asynchronously when a new note is added, ensuring a smooth user experience.
    * Summaries are generated by synthesizing content from *all* notes for a specific book.
- âœ…**Decoupled Architecture:** Separates the backend API (Spring Boot) from the AI summarization service (Python).
- âœ…**Data Persistence:** Stores book and note data in a relational database.





## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1.  **Spring Boot Backend (Java):**
    * Serves as the main API for managing books and notes.
    * Handles data persistence (to the PostgreSQL/MySQL database).
    * Triggers the AI summarization process asynchronously.
    * Fetches and displays the AI-generated summaries.

2.  **AI Summarization Service (Python):**
    * A lightweight web service (using Flask or FastAPI) that exposes an API endpoint for summarization.
    * Loads a pre-trained Hugging Face summarization model (e.g., `distilbart-cnn-12-6`).
    * Receives combined note text from the Spring Boot backend, performs inference, and returns the summary.

3.  **Database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL):**
    * Stores `Books` information (including the generated summary).
    * Stores `Notes` associated with each book.
    * Store `Users` information.

**Interaction Flow:**
1.  User adds a new note via the Spring Boot API.
2.  Spring Boot saves the note to the database.
3.  Spring Boot triggers an **asynchronous** call to the Python AI Summarization Service with all notes for that book.
4.  The Python service processes the notes and returns a summary.
5.  Spring Boot updates the `summarizedNotes` field of the corresponding `Book` in the database.
6.  When a user views book details, the latest available summary is displayed.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:**
    * Java 17+
    * Spring Boot 3.x
    * Spring Data JPA
    * Maven (or Gradle)
    * Lombok (optional, for boilerplate reduction)
* **AI Service:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Flask (or FastAPI)
    * Transformers (Hugging Face)
    * PyTorch (or TensorFlow)
* **Database:**
    * PostgreSQL (Recommended) or MySQL
* **Deployment (for production/demo):**
    * Cloud Providers (e.g., AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean) for VMs or Serverless Functions.
    * Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

* Java 17+ SDK installed
* Maven (or Gradle) installed
* Python 3.9+ installed
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* A running PostgreSQL or MySQL database instance.

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Create a new database (e.g., `book_notes_db`).
2.  Update your Spring Boot `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) with your database connection details.

    ```properties
    # src/main/resources/application.properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/book_notes_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or create, for first run
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect # or MySQLDialect
    ```

### 2. Spring Boot Backend Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-spring-boot-repo-url>
    cd book-notes-summarizer-backend # or your project directory
    ```
2.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
3.  Configure AI Service URL:
    * In `src/main/resources/application.properties`, add the URL for your Python AI service. If running locally, it might be `http://localhost:5000/summarize`.
    ```properties
    ai.summarization.service.url=http://localhost:5000/summarize
    ```
4.  Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### 3. AI Summarization Service (Python) Setup

1.  Clone the repository for the AI service:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-python-ai-service-repo-url>
    cd ai-summarizer-service # or your project directory
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Example requirements.txt content:
    # Flask==2.x.x
    # transformers==4.x.x
    # torch==2.x.x # or tensorflow==2.x.x if using TF
    ```
4.  Run the Flask/FastAPI application:
    ```bash
    python app.py # Assuming your Flask app is in app.py
    # Or for FastAPI: uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The AI service will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once both the Spring Boot backend and the AI summarization service are running:

1.  **Add a Book:**
    * Send a `POST` request to `/books/addNewBook` (or similar endpoint) with book details.
    * Initially, the book's `summarizedNotes` field will be empty.

2.  **Add Notes to a Book:**
    * Send a `POST` request to `/notes` (or similar endpoint) with the note content and the associated `bookId`.
    * After adding **at least two notes** for a book, the Spring Boot backend will asynchronously trigger the AI summarization service.
    * The `summarizedNotes` field of the book will be updated in the database once the summarization is complete (this happens in the background, typically taking a few seconds to tens of seconds depending on your AI service's host).

3.  **View Book Details (and Summary):**
    * Send a `GET` request to `/books/{bookId}` (or `/books/all` to see all books).
    * The response will include the `summarizedNotes` field, which will contain the AI-generated summary if available.

## Key Design Decisions & Notes

* **Asynchronous Summarization:** The summarization process is decoupled and runs in the background. This ensures that adding a note is always fast from the user's perspective, even if the AI inference takes time.
* **"Summarize All Notes from Scratch":** Whenever a new note is added, the system fetches *all* notes for that book, combines them, and generates a fresh summary. This ensures the highest quality and most coherent summary, as the AI always sees the full context.
* **Max 20 Notes per Book:** The project is designed with the understanding that a book will have a maximum of 20 notes. This keeps the combined text length manageable, eliminating the need for complex "long document summarization" techniques (like chunking and recursive summarization) and keeping AI inference times within reasonable limits.
* **Cost Efficiency:** For a capstone project, this setup can be implemented entirely for free by leveraging cloud free tiers and CPU-only AI inference, though with a trade-off in AI processing speed.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* **Frontend UI:** Develop a user interface (e.g., with React, Angular, Vue.js) to interact with the backend API.
* **Real-time Summary Updates:** Implement WebSockets to push summary updates to the frontend as soon as they are ready.
* **User Authentication:** Add user management and authentication.
* **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for AI service failures.
* **Configurable AI Model:** Allow changing the AI model via configuration without code changes.
* **Summary Quality Evaluation:** Implement metrics to evaluate summary quality.

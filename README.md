## üöÄ Architecture

Shelfshare is built with a robust full-stack architecture, comprising a powerful Spring Boot backend, a dynamic React.js frontend, and a reliable PostgreSQL database.

### The project consists of three main components:

1.  **Spring Boot Backend (Java):**
    * Serves as the **main API** for managing books and user interactions.
    * Handles **data persistence** to the PostgreSQL database.

2.  **Database (PostgreSQL):**
    * Stores all **`Books` information**.
    * Manages **`Users` data** and their associations.

3.  **Frontend (React.js):**
    * Provides an **enhanced User Experience (UX)** and an **intuitive User Interface (UI)**.

4. **Notes Summarization API (Python Flask):**
    * Provides AI services for summarizing book notes and generating master titles.
    * Utilizes Hugging Face models for natural language processing tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Java 17+ SDK** (e.g., OpenJDK 24)
* **Gradle**
* A running **PostgreSQL database instance**

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Create a new database for the project (e.g., `shelfshare`).
2.  Update your Spring Boot `application.properties` file with your PostgreSQL database connection details. You'll find this file typically in `backend/shelfshare/src/main/resources/`.

    ```properties
    spring.application.name=shelfshare
    server.port=1234
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/shelfshare
    spring.datasource.username=<your_db_username>
    spring.datasource.password=<your_db_password>
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.jpa.hibernate.format_sql=true
    spring.jpa.hibernate.highlight_sql=true
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

    logging.level.org.springframework.security=DEBUG
    ```
    *Replace `<your_db_username>` and `<your_db_password>` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.*

### 2. Spring Boot Backend Setup

1.  Clone the Shelfshare repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://gitlab.com/pvgharshita/shelfshare.git](https://gitlab.com/pvgharshita/shelfshare.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate into the backend project directory:

    ```bash
    cd shelfshare/backend/shelfshare 
    ```

3.  Build the Spring Boot project using Gradle:

    ```bash
    gradle clean build
    ```

4.  Run the Spring Boot application:

    ```bash
    gradle bootRun
    ```
    The backend API will typically start on `http://localhost:1234`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate into the frontend project directory from the root of the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd ../../frontend/
    ```

2.  Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will usually open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).

### 4. Notes Summarization API Setup

The Notes Summarization API is a separate Python Flask application.

**Prerequisites:**
* Python 3.x
* `pip` (Python package installer)

1.  **Navigate into the `note-summarization` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd shelfshare/note-summarization
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
3.  **Set your Hugging Face API Token:**
    ```
    HF_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN"
    ```
4.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The API will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

### Backend (`shelfshare/backend`)

The backend handles all API requests, business logic, and interactions with the database.

#### Key Components:

* `Controllers/`: Manages HTTP endpoints and request handling.
    * Example: `AnonymousBookController.java`
* `Services/`: Contains the core business logic and orchestrates data operations.
    * Example: `BookService.java`
* `Entities/`: Defines the data models that map to database tables.
    * Example: `Books.java`, `Users.java`
* `Models/`: Defines data transfer objects (DTOs) and response structures.
    * Example: `AnonymousBookResponse.java`

#### Backend Capabilities:

* Provides **RESTful API endpoints** for all features.
* Seamless **integration with PostgreSQL** for data management.
* Uses **Gradle** for efficient dependency management and build automation.
* **Sends transactional emails** (e.g., welcome, borrow request notifications).
* **Automated** cleanup of **expired borrow requests** via a scheduled task.

---

### Frontend (`shelfshare/frontend`)

The frontend provides the interactive user interface for Shelfshare, allowing users to browse, manage, and share books.

#### Key Components:

* `src/components/`: Modular and reusable React UI elements.
* `src/pages/`: Main application views/pages.
* **Axios:** Handles asynchronous API requests to the backend.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for utility-first styling and responsive design.

#### Frontend Capabilities:

* Intuitive **book Browse and searching**.
* Displays **all available books** in a user-friendly format.
* Shows a user's **borrowed books**.
* Presents **enlisted books** that are available for sharing.
* Provides details for **anonymous book entries**.
* Robust **integration with backend APIs** for all data operations.

## üí° Future Enhancements (Ideas)

We have exciting plans for Shelfshare! Here are some ideas for future development:

* **Chat Feature:** Implement a real-time chat system for users to communicate about books or borrow requests.
* **Real-time Updates:** Utilize WebSockets to push instant notifications for events like new borrow requests or status changes.
* **Enhanced Error Handling:** Develop more robust error handling and provide clearer, more helpful user feedback for various scenarios.
* **User Profiles:** Allow users to create more detailed personal profiles with preferred genres, reading history, etc.
